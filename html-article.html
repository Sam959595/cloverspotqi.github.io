        <p class="a">Sometimes, we may encounter the ‘Objects are not valid as a React child. If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead’ error when we’re developing our React apps. Those insights were shared at Adobe Design Summit, the biennial, multi-day celebration of Adobe’s internal design culture. During the two-day virtual broadcast, we learned lessons from the bright and brilliant people who design and refine the Adobe tools and experiences that millions of people use <a href="html-read.html">every day</a>.</p>

And in this lab, we research tiny but tough electronics and materials for space exploration. To enable electronics to work on Venus, my group uses wide bandgap semiconductor materials.</p>
        <blockquote><b>Debbie Senesky:</b> Venus is often called Earth's sister planet, but I would like to say that
            it's Earth's evil twin because it actually has a very hellish environment. Surface temperatures are around
            480 degrees Celsius. The surface pressures are roughly 90 times the pressure that we experience here on
            Earth. And I imagine that it smells like rotten eggs and that's because of some of the sulfur compounds that
            are present.

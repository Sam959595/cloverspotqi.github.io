            <h3 class="b"><mark>Now a new study has found a link between two particular</mark> blood proteins and
                cognitive symptoms six
                months and one year after a COVID diagnosis. What‚Äôs particularly interesting is that the proteins are
                involved in blood clotting. Microclots have been suspected as a likely culprit involved in the causes of
                long COVID for a while, <mark>but this is the first time scientists linked specific blood clotting
                    proteins</mark> have
                with a key symptom of long COVID.
            </h3>
            <h3>Finding this link is a small step ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean a treatment is around the corner ‚Äî and the
                findings don‚Äôt mean that <a href="#">these proteins have</a> a role in causing long COVID. They might
                simply indicate
                something else going on in the body that‚Äôs related to potential causes. But the more scientists can
                understand about the biological processes happening in the body around COVID and long COVID, the more
                likely
                it is that they can eventually come up with ways to counteract some of those processes. As someone who
                has
                been reporting on COVID since the start of the pandemic and who reads dozens of infectious disease
                medical
                studies every month, I‚Äôm excited to see even baby steps being made in understanding this frustration
                condition.

            <h3>Details of the study</h3>
            <h3>The study involved 1,837 adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19. The authors took measurements
                of biomarkers from these adults while they were hospitalized and then assessed their cognitive
                functioning

            <h3>One of the most common symptoms described by many people with long COVID is ‚Äúbrain fog,‚Äù an
                informal
                term for the sluggish thinking and difficulty concentrating or remembering that never seems to
                completely go
                away. It‚Äôs similar to how someone might feel if severely jet-lagged or sleep-deprived, <em>or the icky
                    drowsiness that accompanies certain medications,</em>
                like antihistamines. But with long COVID, brain fog can occur
                regardless of how much rest someone gets.

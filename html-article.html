        <h1>‚ÄòI‚Äôm a new business hunter‚Äô: McCann NY‚Äôs new growth boss on pitching under pressure</h1>
        <span>5 min read ‚Ä¢ On The Scene ‚Ä¢ 2 d ago</span>
        <p class="b">Pitching for new business is a nexus for stress and burnout for staff within the ad industry. But with the economic weather currently blowing against agency fortunes, there‚Äôs necessarily pressure upon execs to find fresh clients and fresh growth ‚Äì to think about the bottom line first and work out how they‚Äôll service new accounts later.</p>
        <p>One of the most common symptoms described by many people with long COVID is ‚Äúbrain fog,‚Äù an
            informal
            term for the sluggish thinking and difficulty concentrating or remembering that never seems to
            completely go
            away. It‚Äôs similar to how someone might feel if severely jet-lagged or sleep-deprived, <em>or the icky
                drowsiness that accompanies certain medications,</em>
            like antihistamines. But with long COVID, brain fog can occur
            regardless of how much rest someone gets.
        </p>
        <h6>Pitching is the principal cause of burnout at ad agencies</h6>

        <p><b>1. Now a new study has found</b> a link between two particular blood proteins and cognitive
            symptoms six
            months and one year after a COVID diagnosis. What‚Äôs particularly interesting is that the proteins are
            involved in blood clotting. Microclots have been suspected as a likely culprit involved in the causes of
            long COVID for a while, but this is the first time scientists have linked specific blood clotting
            proteins
            with a key symptom of long COVID.

        <blockquote>One of the most common symptoms described a new study has found a link between two particular blood proteins</blockquote>
        <p><b>2. Finding this link is a small step</b> ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean a treatment is around the corner ‚Äî and the
            findings don‚Äôt mean that these proteins have a role in causing long COVID. They might simply indicate
            something else going on in the body that‚Äôs related to potential causes. But the more scientists can
            understand about the biological processes happening in the body around COVID and long COVID, the more likely
            it is that they can eventually come up with ways to counteract some of those processes. As someone who has
            been reporting on COVID since the start of the pandemic and who reads dozens of infectious disease medical
            studies every month, I‚Äôm excited to see even baby steps being made in understanding this frustration condition.</p>

        <p>The study involved 1,837 adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19. The authors took
            measurements
            of biomarkers from these adults while they were hospitalized and then assessed their cognitive

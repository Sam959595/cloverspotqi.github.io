        <p>Sometimes, we may encounter the ‘Objects are not valid as a React child. If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead’ error when we’re developing our React apps. Those insights were shared at Adobe Design Summit, the biennial, multi-day celebration of Adobe’s internal design culture. During the two-day virtual broadcast, we learned lessons from the bright and brilliant people who design and refine the Adobe tools and experiences that millions of people use <a href="html-read.html">every day</a>.</p>

        <p>You are sitting in the extreme Environment Microsystems Laboratory or the X Lab at Stanford University. And in this lab, we research tiny but tough electronics and materials for space exploration. To enable electronics to work on Venus, my group uses wide bandgap semiconductor materials.</p>
        <blockquote><b>Debbie Senesky:</b> Venus is often called Earth's sister planet, but I would like to say that
            it's Earth's evil twin because it actually has a very hellish environment. Surface temperatures are around
            480 degrees Celsius. The surface pressures are roughly 90 times the pressure that we experience here on
            Earth. And I imagine that it smells like rotten eggs and that's because of some of the sulfur compounds that
            are present.
